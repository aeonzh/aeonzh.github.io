ECS is Amazon their own take to make a container orchestrator, before surrendering to Kubernetes (therefore, [[AWS EKS]])
Components Task definition: define a job that will be run on the container(s), define also the container(s) resources. One task definition can create several tasks Task: is an instance of a task definition. Service: how many tasks you want to run for how long (at least this is my understanding) Resources What is the difference between a task and a service in AWS ECS?</description></item><item><title>Saving space in Terraform</title><link>https://zhenghe.hu/notes/Saving-space-in-Terraform/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhenghe.hu/notes/Saving-space-in-Terraform/</guid><description>In [[Terraform]], by default terraform init will automatically download the providers/plugins and modules and place them under .terraform in the current working directory. This is very convenient as it treat each &amp;ldquo;Terraform project&amp;rdquo; as independent configuration.
At work as a [[DevOps]] engineer I have many AWS resources managed using Terraform and it is awesome. Each part is configured as separate &amp;ldquo;project&amp;rdquo; this is very useful when it comes to debugging, also we find it more convenient not having to risk to affect the whole infrastructure while making changes on some part of it.</description></item></channel></rss>
