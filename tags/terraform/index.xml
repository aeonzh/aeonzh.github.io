This is very convenient as it treat each &amp;ldquo;Terraform project&amp;rdquo; as independent configuration.
At work as a [[DevOps]] engineer I have many AWS resources managed using Terraform and it is awesome. Each part is configured as separate &amp;ldquo;project&amp;rdquo; this is very useful when it comes to debugging, also we find it more convenient not having to risk to affect the whole infrastructure while making changes on some part of it.</description></item></channel></rss>
