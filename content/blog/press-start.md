I am starting to use Vim on a daily basis mainly for better productivity, Vim's shortcuts and the entire environment which doesn't include the mouse is fantastic \*thumbs up\* and naturally to get the feel to be more like a "pro". That said I still love Sublime Text and I believe I will stick with it for a long time, not to mention that I kind of dislike Atom, for some reason the feeling isn't great and even though I tried to switch to it many times in different times of the development I just don't like it (sorry Atom fans out there). Oh yeah VS Code is not bad, good job Microsoft.

LaTeX: during the writing of my resume for internships/jobs I was using Markdown but found that it doesn't give the number of pages I already wrote. That was annoying, knowing that resumes are supposed to be one-page size. Probably that is just an excuse but I am happy with that since it's still a useful skill after all. I really need an actual project to work on with to feel motivated.

ReactJS: this was kind of inspirational, I was just wandering on this Italian forum-platform called Forumfree.it which I used to use very often and there was this user which coded a skin, the design was really good and the code part was clean too. By further stalking I found out that this user was Chinese, this made me even more curious (I'm both Chinese and was born in Italy too) and had this personal portfolio.

Finally, I just hope that the resolution doesn't fade away too early, in that case I probably can just make the same New Year Resolutions for the next year!
