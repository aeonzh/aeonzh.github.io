Hello there, my name is Zheng He.

Lately I've fallen in the "digital gardening" rabbit hole and wanted to give the [inspiration](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) some practical application.

The plan is to have an ever-WIP [Zettelkasten](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NfdHG6oHBJ8Qxc26s/the-zettelkasten-method-1) on techincal and non-technical topics

Since this is my first implementation of the idea, it currently looks more of a "public stream of consciousness" and "writing exercise" that I may get back and change.

Example notes:
- [[Ego is the Enemy]] by [[Ryan Holiday]]
- [[Amazon Aurora]]
- [[Thinking, Fast and Slow]]
