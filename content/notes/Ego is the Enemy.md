# Talk, talk, talk, talk

- Silence is a strength
- Just spending hours talking about doing something doesn't count as doing it

# To be or to do?

- Pretend to have virtues or be virtuous? Try to impress people of be truly impressive? Not actually good examples
- "to be" has compromises
- "to do" means having a purpose, there is only one way, but is hard

# Become a student

- Never cease to improve
- Never think of knowing enough
- Have a lesser whom to teach, an equal to confront and a better to learn from
- "It is impossible to learn that which one thinks one already knows" - Epictetus
- Be open to feedback

# Don't be passionate

- Be reasonable
- Don't be passionate, have a purpose
- Passion highlights the ego e.g. _I_  am passionate about...
- Purpose gives clear path e.g. I must _do_ ... _in order to_ ...
- Consistent system of improvement is the key, not epiphanies. It's not as exciting though...

# Follow the canvas strategy

- Make other look good as mean for self improvement
- Looking good is short-term gratification
- Be selfless
- Be the _anteambulo_, the person scouts the way for his patrons. But the person who walks the way first is also who shapes it

# Restrain yourself

- Self-control no matter the anger, the circumstances
- Think about the bigger scheme

# Get out of your own head

- Live the present clearly, don't be deluded by the ideas in your head

# The danger of early pride

- Pride and ego are best buddies, what's new?

# Work, work, work

- Having an idea is not enough! Put on work!

# Always stay a student

- Maintain the mentality to be always a student and open to learn new things
- The moment we believe we know enough is also the moment we stop to learn

# Don't tell yourself a story

- Narratives comes from a sentiment of arrogance or self-defense
- Real success comes from constant attention for details

# What's important to you

- Euthymia: tranquility
  - Don't get distracted from your path

# Managing yourself

- It is not enough having great qualities, be able to manage them
- Learn to delegate things to other people
- Responsibility requires clarity and purpose

# Beware the disease of me

- Innocent Climb -> Disease of Me
- Ego needs honors to be validated, confidence is able to focus and complete tasks regardless of external recognition

# Meditate on the immensity

- The connection with the cosmos (_sympatheia_) let us realize our "smallness"
  - This will keep the ego in check
  - At the same time we shouldn't forget our "greatness"

# Maintain our sobriety

- Having goals that affect many doesn't give us the necessity to appear in front of many

# Alive time or dead time

- We choose how to use our time. A _dead_ time can be converted to _alive_ if we have clear goal in mind
  - The key is to stay humble, to accept the situation and act with what is our power
- It is easier to blame the circumstances

# The effort is not enough

- Do the right thing
  - Don't worry about what we cannot control, i.e. the outcome from that action. Ego expects recognition, validation
- Our worth is not determined by anyone but ourselves

# Fight club moments

- Refers to when someone hits the rock bottom
- There are two ways to react to this:
  - Anger, blame, fear. That's ego
  - Or do what is in our power and rise again

# Draw the line

- When we fuck up, when is the time to stop? Stop to find excuses. Stop to try to salvage our own self-esteem
- Failure and embarrassment are only steps in life, everyone has them. Only ego thinks they are important.
- We don't do good by avoiding failure, but overcoming it

# Maintain your own scorecard

- Give yourself goals and try to meet them. What others say is irrelevant

# Always love

- Streisland effect: trying to fight something only to achieve a worse result
  - From Barbra Streisland who tried to take down some personal picture from the Internet only the get more popular
